# Calculator

### Purpose
To develop a fully working calculator on the web with clean and interesting UI.

### Features
- Button animations
- Clear button
- +/- button
- All four major operators
- Float operations
- Float rounding
- Single operations at a time
- Syntax and Divide by 0 errors

### Reflection
This project pushed me to the limit regarding the complexity and handling of the different features a calculator can have.  It was very useful to breakdown the development into chunks and focus on certain features at a time.  Slowly but surely, all of the required features were implemented with success.
